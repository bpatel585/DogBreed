# DogBreedClassifier
-This is a project which detects 10 different dog breeds

# Key features are :
-This model is trained on Tensorflow 2.3.0 object classification.
-To train the model, famous Kaggle Dataset which consists of 120 different breeds, out of which 10 famous breeds were taken for simplicity.
-Took nearly 860 images of 10 breeds.
-For training,Resnet50 model as base model is used for feature extraction.
-After training, training accuracy reached 98% with testing accuracy nearing 94%.
-built a wep application using flask API but couldn't deploy the model as it would require me to buy a costly gpu instance.


<h3> Detailed training is explained in DogBreed.ipynb file. </h3>

<h4>Trained model 'model.h5' is available in google drive with <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dGLvmSlCQHAno45yVk-K6AcWhIBANzEM/view?usp=sharing">this link</a></h4>
